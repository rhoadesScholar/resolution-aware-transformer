# Code Cleanup Summary

## Completed on: September 17, 2025

### Debug Print Statements Converted to Proper Logging

#### `experiments/common/datasets.py`
- **Added**: `import logging` and `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`
- **Replaced**: 3 debug print statements with `logger.debug()` calls:
  - `print(f"DEBUG: COCODataset data_dir = {self.data_dir}")` → `logger.debug(f"COCODataset data_dir = {self.data_dir}")`
  - `print(f"DEBUG: Looking for annotation file: {ann_file}")` → `logger.debug(f"Looking for annotation file: {ann_file}")`
  - `print(f"DEBUG: Annotation file exists: {ann_file.exists()}")` → `logger.debug(f"Annotation file exists: {ann_file.exists()}")`

#### `experiments/ablations/ablation_study.py`
- **Fixed**: Duplicate logging condition blocks that were causing redundant code
- **Cleaned**: Nested `if logger:` statements into a single clean conditional

### Temporary Files Removed

#### Debugging and Fix Scripts (No Longer Needed)
- `experiments/scripts/final_fix_summary.py` - Final fix summary script used during debugging session
- `experiments/scripts/test_recent_fixes.py` - Temporary test script for validating fixes
- `experiments/scripts/fix_training_issues.py` - Initial training issue fix script
- `experiments/scripts/fix_memory_and_paths.py` - Memory and path fix script

#### Python Cache Files
- Removed all `__pycache__` directories from `experiments/`
- Removed all `.pyc` files from `experiments/`

### Files Preserved

#### Essential Utility Scripts (Kept)
- `experiments/scripts/setup_*.py` - Dataset and environment setup scripts
- `experiments/scripts/update_*.py` - Configuration update scripts  
- `experiments/scripts/fix_common_issues.py` - General purpose fix utility

#### Training and Coordination Scripts
- Print statements in training scripts (`train.py` files) were **preserved** as they provide essential user feedback during training
- Print statements in coordination scripts (`run_experiments.py`) were **preserved** as they provide workflow status updates

### Logging Best Practices Applied

1. **Debug Information**: Now uses `logger.debug()` instead of print statements
2. **Proper Module Loggers**: Each module uses `logging.getLogger(__name__)`
3. **Contextual Logging**: Debug logs include relevant context for troubleshooting
4. **User Feedback**: Training progress and status messages still use print for immediate console output

### Impact

- **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed 4 temporary debugging scripts (~650 lines of temporary code)
- **Better Debugging**: Debug information now respects logging levels and can be controlled via configuration
- **Maintainability**: Consistent logging patterns across the codebase
- **Performance**: No unnecessary print statements cluttering debug output

### Next Steps

When running experiments, debug logging can be enabled by setting the logging level:
```python
import logging
logging.getLogger('experiments.common.datasets').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

Or via environment variable:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/resolution-aware-transformer:$PYTHONPATH
export LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG
```
